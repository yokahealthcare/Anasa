UPDATE 4 March 2023:
1. Learning How LSTM Works
2. [Try using simple ANN, not LSTM] 
	- using StandardScaler = 76.80% accuracy
	- using MinMaxScaler = 76.77% accuracy

PROBLEM
1. I think there is UPDATE on Keras LSTM Algorithm input_shape, because it threw an error (I try to implemented code from older tutorial online course video)
2. Still figure out how to implement LSTM to multiple classfication problem
